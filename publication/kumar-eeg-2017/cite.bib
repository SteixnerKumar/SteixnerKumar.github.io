 abstract = {Obesity as an epidemic is a major contributor to ill-health, disability and mortality worldwide and therefore intervention is of utmost
importance. Brain regions involved in the reappraisal of tasty but
unhealthy foods are of special interest for the development of new
therapeutic interventions for obesity. Using electroencephalogram
(EEG), we visually presented food items to obese and lean individuals, while they admitted or reappraised their desire for food. During
admitting the desire for low and high calorie food, obese as well as
lean individuals showed higher activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), whereas the right frontal operculum was involved in the reappraisal of the same food, suggesting interplay between executive control and gustatory regions. In lean participants,
we found an interaction between calorie content and admit/reappraise
condition in bilateral anterior insular cortices, suggesting that the
anterior insula, assumed to primarily host gustatory processes, also
underpins higher cognitive processes involved in food choices, such
as evaluating the foods’ calorie content for its reappraisal. We also
questioned how eating to satiety affects food reappraisal abilities
and corresponding neuronal activity in the left DLPFC and right
frontal operculum in lean and obese women. When hungry, lean
women self-rated the ability to reappraise visually presented food as
more difficult than allowing desire for the same food. Obese hungry
women instead rated their ability to reappraise food as equally well
as allowing the desire, probably suggesting hunger-related impaired
self-reflection of food reappraisal abilities. In obese women frontal
operculum was involved in the reappraisal of foods and surprisingly
also in admitting the desire for the same food suggesting that right
frontal operculum in the obese female brain underpins evaluation
processes involved in regulation of food desire after eating to satiety. Therefore, the frontal operculum may in future serve as a target
for non-invasive brain stimulation or neurofeedback studies that aim
at modulating eating behavior in obese women towards better food
reappraisal abilities.},
