These abilities are multi-faceted and include a variety of different cognitive sub-functions. Here, we focus on decision processes in social contexts and review a number of experimental and computational modeling approaches in this field. We provide an overview of experimental accounts and formal computational models with respect to two dimensions: interactivity and uncertainty. Thereby, we aim at capturing the nuances of ToM functions in the context of social decision processes. We suggest there to be an increase in ToM engagement and multiplexing as social cognitive decision-making tasks become more interactive and uncertain. We propose that representing others as intentional and goal directed agents who perform consequential actions is elicited only at the edges of these two dimensions. Further, we argue that computational models of valuation and beliefs follow these dimensions to best allow researchers to effectively model sophisticated ToM-processes. Finally, we relate this typology to neuroimaging findings in neurotypical (NT) humans, studies of persons with autism spectrum (AS), and studies of nonhuman primates.","tags":["Computational modeling","Decision making","Interactivity","Theory of mind","Uncertainty"],"title":"Theory of mind and decision science: Towards a typology of tasks and computational models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saurabh Kumar","Tessa Rusch","Prashant Doshi","Michael Spezio","Jan Gläscher"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"5382f5d34708f4099bba69738f0408a8","permalink":"https://steixnerkumar.github.io/publication/kumar-modeling-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-14T10:44:48.58884Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kumar-modeling-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Cooperation and competition are fundamental modes of social interaction. It is imperative that we study such behavior to unravel the staggering complexities of the human brain. We aim to develop a modelling framework to disentangle the neural underpinnings of such behavior with a sophisticated design of the iconic tiger task. The task revolves around the nuances of human decision making where the participant is choosing between two doors hiding a tiger or a gold pot and an option of taking a hint. The task becomes more demanding in the multiplayer setting where one needs to either synchronize actions with the other participant (cooperation) or outsmart the other participant (competition) in order to earn maximum reward. We estimate logistic discrete choice models with Bayesian Hierarchical modeling to model the participants’ choices in the single and multiplayer versions of the task. The inclusion of the social information in the model for the multiplayer version significantly improves the model fit. As an extension to this descriptive model, we will use I-POMDP that explicitly models the other participant as an intentional agent to investigate the theory of mind of cooperation and competition further.","tags":["bayesian hierarchical modeling","competition","cooperation","ipomdp"],"title":"Modeling Cooperation and Competition in the Tiger Task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saurabh Kumar","Tessa Rusch","Prashant Doshi","Michael Spezio","Jan Gläscher"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"589f5098fa5fe805bcee540cd26fd430","permalink":"https://steixnerkumar.github.io/publication/kumar-modeling-2019-1/","publishdate":"2020-05-14T10:44:48.591833Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kumar-modeling-2019-1/","section":"publication","summary":"The mathematical models underlying reinforcement learning helpus understand howagents navigate the world and maximize future reward. Partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) –an extension of classic RL –allow for action planning in uncertainenvironments. In this study we set out to investigate human decision-making under these circumstances in the context of cooperation and competitionusing the iconic Tiger Task(TT)in single-player and cooperative and competitive multi-player versions. The task mimics the setting of a game show,in which the participant has to choose between two doors hiding eithera tiger (-100 points) or a treasure (+10 points)or taking a probabilistic hint about the tiger location (-1 point). In addition to the probabilistic location hints, the multi-player TTalso includesprobabilistic information about the other player's actions.POMDPshave been successfully used in simulations of the single-player TT. A critical feature are the beliefs (probability distributions) about current position in the state space. However, here we leverage interactivePOMDPs(I-POMDPs) for the modeling choicedata from the cooperative and competitive multi-player TT. I-POMDPs construct a model of the other player's beliefs, which are incorporatedinto the own valuation process. We demonstrate using hierarchical logistic regression modeling that the cooperative context elicits better choices and more accurate predictions of the other player's actions. Furthermore, we show that participantsgenerate Bayesian beliefs to guide their actions. Critically, including the social information in the belief updating improves model performanceunderliningthat participants use this informationin theirbeliefcomputations. In the next step we will useI-POMDPs that explicitly modelother playersas an intentional agentsto investigate the generationof mental modelsand Theory of Mind in cooperative and competitive decision-making in humans.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling cooperative and competitive decision-making in the Tiger Task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saurabh Kumar","Felicitas Grundeis","Cristin Brand","Han-Jeong Hwang","Jan Mehnert","Burkhard Pleger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"2ddabdfaf658b50c16418671afa6a2cd","permalink":"https://steixnerkumar.github.io/publication/kumar-satiety-induced-2018/","publishdate":"2020-05-14T10:44:48.586845Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kumar-satiety-induced-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"In the present pilot study, we questioned how eating to satiety affects cognitive influences on the desire for food and corresponding neuronal activity in the obese female brain.

The localization of deep brain generators of the electric fields is essential for understanding neuronal function in healthy humans and for damasking specific regions that cause abnormal activity in patients with neurological disorders. The aim of this study was to test whether the phase estimation from scalp data can be reliably used to identify the number of dipoles in source analyses. The steps performed included: i) modeling different phasic oscillatory signals using auto-regressive processes at a particular frequency, ii) simulation of two different noises, namely white and colored noise, having different signal-to-noise ratios, iii) simulation of dipoles at different areas in the brain and iv) estimation of the number of dipoles by calculating the phase differences of the simulated signals. Moreover we applied this method of source analysis on real data from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients. The analytical framework was successful in identifying the sources and their orientations in the simulated data and identified the epileptogenic area in the studied patients which was confirmed by pathological studies after TLE surgery.","tags":["autoregressive processes","bioelectric potentials","Brain","Brain Mapping","Brain modeling","brain oscillatory activity","deep brain generator localization","EEG","electroencephalogram","electroencephalography","Electroencephalography","Epilepsy","epileptogenic area","Frequency estimation","Head","Humans","medical disorders","medical signal processing","neurological disorder","neuronal function","neurophysiology","phasic oscillatory signal","scalp data","Signal to noise ratio","signal-to-noise ratio","Signal-To-Noise Ratio","source analysis method","Surgery","Temporal Lobe","temporal lobe epilepsy","TLE surgery"],"title":"Establishing and validating a new source analysis method using phase","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saurabh Kumar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"9551fe1e8a7dfe729f87bd0e818f4965","permalink":"https://steixnerkumar.github.io/publication/kumar-eeg-2017/","publishdate":"2020-05-14T10:44:48.598821Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kumar-eeg-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Obesity as an epidemic is a major contributor to ill-health, disability and mortality worldwide and therefore intervention is of utmost importance. Brain regions involved in the reappraisal of tasty but unhealthy foods are of special interest for the development of new therapeutic interventions for obesity. Using electroencephalogram (EEG), we visually presented food items to obese and lean individuals, while they admitted or reappraised their desire for food. During admitting the desire for low and high calorie food, obese as well as lean individuals showed higher activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), whereas the right frontal operculum was involved in the reappraisal of the same food, suggesting interplay between executive control and gustatory regions. In lean participants, we found an interaction between calorie content and admit/reappraise condition in bilateral anterior insular cortices, suggesting that the anterior insula, assumed to primarily host gustatory processes, also underpins higher cognitive processes involved in food choices, such as evaluating the foods’ calorie content for its reappraisal. We also questioned how eating to satiety affects food reappraisal abilities and corresponding neuronal activity in the left DLPFC and right frontal operculum in lean and obese women. When hungry, lean women self-rated the ability to reappraise visually presented food as more difficult than allowing desire for the same food. Obese hungry women instead rated their ability to reappraise food as equally well as allowing the desire, probably suggesting hunger-related impaired self-reflection of food reappraisal abilities. In obese women frontal operculum was involved in the reappraisal of foods and surprisingly also in admitting the desire for the same food suggesting that right frontal operculum in the obese female brain underpins evaluation processes involved in regulation of food desire after eating to satiety. Therefore, the frontal operculum may in future serve as a target for non-invasive brain stimulation or neurofeedback studies that aim at modulating eating behavior in obese women towards better food reappraisal abilities.","tags":null,"title":"EEG study on the differences between lean and obese individuals during regulation of food desire","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felicitas Grundeis","Cristin Brand","Saurabh Kumar","Michael Rullmann","Jan Mehnert","Burkhard Pleger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"e7eb30ef4ce78665e7cec4f7a2db3d47","permalink":"https://steixnerkumar.github.io/publication/grundeis-non-invasive-2017/","publishdate":"2020-05-14T10:44:48.58186Z","relpermalink":"/publication/grundeis-non-invasive-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Background/Objectives: Previous studies suggest that non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the prefrontal cortex modulates food choices and calorie intake in obese humans.Participants/Methods: In the present fully randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject and double-blinded study, we applied single sessions of anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and contralateral frontal operculum in 25 hungry obese women and investigated possible influences on food reappraisal abilities as well as calorie intake.
